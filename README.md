# ðŸ§  Algorithm Practice: Merge Sort & Fibonacci

This project contains simple yet fundamental algorithm implementations done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The focus is on recursive thinking and solving problems like the Fibonacci sequence and Merge Sort from scratch using JavaScript.

### `fibonacci.js`
- `fibs(limit)` â†’ Iterative Fibonacci generator
- `fibsRec(limit)` â†’ Recursive Fibonacci generator

### `mergeSort.js`
- `mergeSort(arr)` â†’ Recursive merge sort implementation
- Includes a custom `merge()` function to combine sorted halves

## ðŸš€ Sample Inputs & Outputs

### Fibonacci:
```js
fibs(8); 
// âžœ [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

fibsRec(10); 
// âžœ [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

### Merge Sort:
```js
mergeSort([3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1]);
// âžœ [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

mergeSort([105, 79, 100, 110]);
// âžœ [79, 100, 105, 110]
```

## ðŸ§© What I Learned
- The difference between iterative and recursive thinking.
- How to break problems down using base cases and divide & conquer logic.
- The concept of binary sort in mergeSort and how beautifully are these algorithms are directly associated with our real lives.
- How recursion builds up the solution from the ground.
- The importance of clean code, small reusable functions, and test-driven thinking.
